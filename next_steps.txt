PROJECT ROADMAP & FUTURE WORK

1. EXTEND DATASET
   - Current: Trained on 5-10 Bitbrains trace files.
   - Future: Train on the full 1TB Google Cluster Trace to improve model generalization.

2. EDGE COMPUTING DEPLOYMENT
   - Test the lightweight LSTM model on Raspberry Pi clusters (K3s) to prove Edge capability.

3. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL)
   - Replace the "Threshold Logic" with a Q-Learning agent that receives "Rewards" for uptime and "Penalties" for wasting resources.

4. NETWORK METRICS
   - Currently predicting CPU only.
   - Future: Add Network I/O and Memory Bandwidth to the LSTM input vector for multi-variate forecasting.
